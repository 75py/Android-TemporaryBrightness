# Temporary Brightness [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/75py/Android-TemporaryBrightness.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/75py/Android-TemporaryBrightness)

Override your screen brightness temporary.

## Use case

* Show others your photos  
If you set low brightness for battery-save, screen brightness is too dark for others to see.  
But if you change the brightness setting, you must undo it every time. That's a pain.  
  
If you use "Temporary Brightness", overriding brightness stops automatically when the screen turns off.
